	<h2>Travel</h2>

	<p id = "travel">In the autumn of 2022, my wife and I took my daughter to Florence to spend a few days with my her grandparents. Seren proved herself quite the saavy traveler, sampling much of the great cuisine that Florence had to offer. She tried octopus and fell in love with gelato. She was quite impressed by Michaelangelo's Statue of David.</p>

	<h2>Pet Names</h2>

		<li> Two beagles named Gem and Scout. </li>

	<h2> Favorite Foods </h2>
	<a href="https://mammalisapizza.com/" target="_blank">Mamma Lisa's Pizzeria</a> <br \>
	<p>Mamma Lisa's Pizzeria does a solid slice, but where they really shine is with their Eggplant Parm Sub. It's so so good. Also it's a pretty chill place to sit. They've either got Pawn Stars or Leave It to Beaver on the TV. Very chill spot to stop in for some lunch after a long day of web programming... in fact...</p> <br /><br />

			<p>My favorite food is eggplant parmasean. It's just about the only dish I'll go to the trouble of deep-frying for. The trick is to sweat the sliced eggplant for at least 30 min prior to battering to remove the more bitter compounds, then pat dry before coating with seasoned flour, dredging in beaten egg, and covering with breadcrumbs (I prefer panko). Then deep fry until golden brown. Then we place that on a thin layer of tomato sauce, top with a bit of low moisture mozzerella and blast it under the broiler for a few couple minutes and serve with pasta of choice. Delicious... can you tell that I like eggplant parm?</p>
